### Overview

For your 4th project, you'll have the choice of building a MERN stack app or a Rails + React app. Use your imagination! You get to create whatever you want for this app. This project will be solo.

You'll need to run your user stories, wireframes, and database design by your instructors to get their feedback and approval before you begin coding! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope creep / feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

Identify what you need to build and accomplish to meet project expectations and
identify everything else as stretch goals. If you meet your MVP (Minimum Viable
Product) ahead of schedule, you can decide which reach goals to focus on for the
remainder of your time.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Deployment and Functionality__: Is your application deployed and functional at a public URL? Is your application free of errors and incomplete functionality?
